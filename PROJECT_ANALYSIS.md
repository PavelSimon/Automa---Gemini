# Automa-Gemini Project Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a web application for managing, monitoring, scheduling, and auditing Python scripts and agents. The application provides a web-based interface for managing the entire lifecycle of these scripts, from execution to logging. The backend is built with FastAPI, and the frontend will be a simple HTML/CSS/JS dashboard. The application also features a REST API for remote management and integration.

## Current Implementation Status

### Technologies Used
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with password hashing
- **Task Scheduling:** Celery/APScheduler (planned)
- **Sandboxing:** Docker/VM/chroot jail (planned)
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript (planned)

### Files and Structure
- `main.py` - Main FastAPI application with authentication endpoints
- `models.py` - Database models (User, Agent, Script, Task)
- `crud.py` - Database CRUD operations
- `schemas.py` - Pydantic models for data validation
- `auth.py` - Authentication logic with JWT
- `database.py` - Database connection setup
- `pyproject.toml` - Project dependencies

### Implemented Features
- User authentication with password hashing
- JWT token-based authentication system
- Basic CRUD operations for users
- Database initialization and connection management
- REST API endpoints for user management

## Database Models

### User Model
- id (Integer, primary key)
- email (String, unique, indexed)
- hashed_password (String)

### Agent Model
- id (Integer, primary key)
- name (String, indexed)
- description (String)
- status (String)

### Script Model
- id (Integer, primary key)
- name (String, indexed)
- description (String)
- filename (String)

### Task Model
- id (Integer, primary key)
- name (String, indexed)
- description (String)
- script_id (Integer)
- agent_id (Integer)

## Development Recommendations

Based on the project requirements and current implementation, here's how to continue development:

### 1. Implement Core Functionality
- Add endpoints for managing agents (create, read, update, delete)
- Implement script management capabilities
- Create task scheduling functionality using Celery or APScheduler

### 2. Enhance Security
- Implement role-based access control (admin/user roles)
- Add proper sandboxing mechanisms for script execution
- Implement comprehensive audit logging

### 3. Build Frontend Dashboard
- Create HTML/CSS/JS interface for monitoring and managing agents/scripts/tasks
- Implement real-time monitoring capabilities

### 4. Add Advanced Features
- Implement task scheduling with Celery/APScheduler
- Add detailed logging and auditing system
- Create API endpoints for remote management and integration

### 5. Complete Documentation
- Update README with build and run instructions
- Document API endpoints and usage
- Add deployment guidelines

## Next Steps

The project has a solid foundation with authentication and database structure in place. The next steps should focus on implementing the core application logic for managing Python scripts and agents, along with the monitoring and scheduling features.

### Immediate Priorities:
1. Implement agent management endpoints
2. Add script execution capabilities
3. Set up task scheduling system
4. Create basic frontend dashboard
5. Implement audit logging

### Long-term Goals:
1. Full sandboxing implementation
2. Advanced monitoring and alerting
3. Plugin/module architecture
4. Enhanced security features
5. Comprehensive API documentation
